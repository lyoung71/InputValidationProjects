Description - This program uses regexes and the "pyinputplus" module to make a multiplication quiz that only accepts answers that conform to a certain regex pattern. The each question has a built in timer and attempt limit. 

Instructions - Users will need to download and import the "pyinputplus" module by typing "pip install --user pyinputplus" into their terminal.

Credits - The tutorial that I used for this project can be found in chapter eight of Al Sweigart's book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter8/).
