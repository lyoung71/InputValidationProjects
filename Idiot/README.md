Description - This program uses while loops and the "pyinputplus" module to create an endless loop unless the user responds "no." I also made Spanish and Portuguese versions of the function by changing the yes and no values to their equivalents in those languages.

Instructions - Users will need to download and import the "pyinputplus" module by typing "pip install --user pyinputplus" into their terminal.

Credits - The tutorial that I used for this project can be found in chapter eight of Al Sweigart's book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter8/).
