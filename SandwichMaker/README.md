Description - A sandwhich-making program that uses the "PyInputPlus" module to allow users to build their own sandwiches with a series of inputs. Prices for each item are contained in a dictionary and are totaled at the end to provide the user with the total cost. 

Instructions - Users will need to download and import the "pyinputplus" module by typing "pip install --user pyinputplus" into their terminal.

Credits - The tutorial that I used for this project can be found in chapter eight of Al Sweigart's book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter8/).
